./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
```
  
That's it!

### Configuration

Gnome extension weather use gsettings to save your configuration. you can use dconf-editor or gsettings from the command line to modify some parameters

#### Location (cf. [WOEID](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/guide/concepts.html))

You can specify your location buy using this command:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather woeid your_woeid
```

#### Temperature units (optional, celsius by default)

You can modify the temperature unit with one of the following commands:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather unit celsius
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather unit fahrenheit
```

#### Displayed location (optional)

Sometimes your WOEID location isn't quite right (it's the next major city around). To customise the displayed city you can type:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather city your_city
```

#### Translate weather conditions (optional, true by default)

You may want to configure whether to translate the weather condition. If enabled, the condition is translated based on the weather code. If disabled, the condition string from Yahoo is taken. Note: Enabling the translation sometimes results in loss of accuracy, e.g., the condition string "PM Thunderstorms" cannot be expressed in terms of weather codes.

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather translate-condition true
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather translate-condition false
```

#### Restart Gnome-Shell

Don't forget to restart GNOME Shell:
